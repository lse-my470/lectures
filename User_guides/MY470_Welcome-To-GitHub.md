# Welcome to GitHub!

GitHub is a code sharing site for programmers. Think of it as a combination of a cloud storage platform and a back-up service for all of your Computer Programming needs. Whilst there are virtual learning environments (such as Moodle) that are used throughout the University, learning GitHub is a fundamental part of collaboration in computational projects.
We will be using GitHub throughout the course so it’s important we make sure you are familiar with how it works. 

This document serves as a theoretical introduction to GitHub. In this repository (defined later) there are additional files that provide information on different ways you can use the platform.

## What exactly is GitHub?
At the centre of GitHub is Git, an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Git is a Version Control System (VCS), a category of software tools that help teams manage changes to source code over time. VSCs keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. It’s a filing system for every draft of a document.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service. A repository (or repo) tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. The project is generally formed of a local directory - a location/folder for storing your files on your computer. A Git repository is where these files and changes are tracked on GitHub. 

As well as using GitHub to back up our code and projects, we can also use it to contribute to an existing project. Like with the repos we will use in this course; we can use GitHub to essentially download all of the files associated with a repository onto our local drive on a computer. Any changes that are made locally, can then be uploaded shared to the wider project.

## GitHub Student Developer Pack
**Visit Here: https://education.github.com/pack/offers**

GitHub provides a free pack of real-world tools that Students can use so they can learn by doing. By verifying your University email address you can get free access to a range of software packages, Domain services, Databases, and Cloud recourse (such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure). 

The Student Pack also gives you free access to GitHub Pro services and GitKraken Pro Suite which can enhance your experiences with GitHub.

The pack also has alternative Integrated Development Environments (IDE) which might interest you as you develop your skills. For instance, PyCharm by Jet Brains has integrated Git VCS. This means you can work with your GitHub repo from within the IDE itself.

## Key Terms
Before we set up GitHub it is crucial that we familiarise you with some key terms. The definitions below will help you follow the instructions to set up GitHub for your course and troubleshoot any problems you may have. These terms aren’t specific to GitHub; they are used anywhere that employs Git VCS.

**Branch**
> A version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. Branches can be a new version of a repository, experimental changes, or personal forks of a repository for users to alter and test changes.

**Bash**
> Bash is a Unix shell and command language. It is the language used in "Git Bash".

**Checkout**
> The git checkout command is used to switch branches in a repository.

**Clone**
> A clone is a copy of a repository or the action of copying a repository. 

**Command Line**
> Same as terminal. An interface for typing commands directly to a computer's operating system

**Context Menu**
> A context menu is a menu in a graphical user interface that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click mouse operation. A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application to which the menu belongs. In Windows it is accessed by right clicking on a object, and in Mac by Control + click.

**Fetch**
> By performing a Git fetch, you are downloading and copying that branch’s files to your computer. Multiple branches can be fetched at once, and you can rename the branches when running the command to suit your needs.

**Fork**
> Creates a copy of a repository.

**HEAD**
> HEAD (capitals) is a reference variable used to denote the most current commit of the repository in which you are working. When you add a new commit, HEAD will then become that new commit.

**Master**
>The primary branch of all repositories. All committed and accepted changes should be on the master branch. You can work directly from the master branch, or create other branches.

**Merge**
> Taking the changes from one branch and adding them into another (traditionally the master) branch. These commits are usually first requested via pull request before being merged by the user who maintains the project.

**Origin**
> The conventional name for the primary version of a repository. Git also uses origin as a system alias for pushing and fetching data to and from the primary branch. 

**Pull/Pull Request**
>If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to be reviewed to add to the master branch, that someone can put in a pull request. Pull requests ask the user who maintains the repo to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. A pull happens when adding the changes to the master branch.

**Push**
> Updates a remote branch with the commits made to the current branch. You are literally “pushing” your changes onto the remote.

**Remote**
> A copy of the original branch. When you clone a branch, that new branch is a remote, or clone. Remotes can talk to the origin branch, as well as other remotes for the repository, to make communication between working branches easier.

**Shell**
> A text based command line interface. Asoftware program that interprets commands from the user so that the operating system can understand them and perform the appropriate functions.

**Terminal**
> The command line interface (or simply command line) used on Mac (Apple) Computers.

**Unix**
> UNIX is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s, and has been under constant development ever since. It is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix at Bell Labs.

**Upstream**
> While there is not necessarily a default “upstream” or “downstream” for Git projects, upstream can be considered where you push your Git changes — this is often the master branch of the project within the origin
